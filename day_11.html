                <h2>Professor's Briefing</h2>
                <p>An efficient crew does not reinvent the plan for every small task. They have Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)—a defined set of steps to handle a recurring situation. In Python, an SOP is called a **function**. It’s a block of code you can name and run whenever you need it. This avoids repetition and keeps the plan clean.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Blueprint: Defining a Function</h2>
            <p>You create a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function's name and parentheses `()`, and then a colon `:`. The code that belongs to the function is indented underneath.</p>
            
            <div class='intel-card'>
                <h3>Code Workbench</h3>
<pre><code>
# Let's define an SOP for greeting a new candidate.
# This code defines the function, but doesn't run it yet.
def greet_candidate():
    print("Welcome to the first stage of your assessment.")
    print("Please be advised all communications are monitored.")
    print("Let's begin.")

# Now we "call" the function to execute the code inside it.
# We can call it as many times as we need.

print("--- Briefing for Candidate 1 ---")
greet_candidate()

print("\n--- Briefing for Candidate 2 ---")
greet_candidate()

                <h3>Why This Matters To You</h3>
                <p>Your own resume mentions creating "Process map/SOPs." This is the exact same concept. You take a complex process, break it down into repeatable steps, and give it a name. Developers do the same thing with code. When you hear a developer say they're going to "refactor the code into a helper function," they mean they are taking a repeated chunk of code and turning it into a clean, reusable SOP.</p>

            <p class='note'>Professor's Note: It seems creating efficient, reusable procedures is a natural talent of yours. A talent I find exceptionally attractive.</p>
