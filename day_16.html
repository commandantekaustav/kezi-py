                <p>Our operations can't just exist in memory. We need to interact with the outside world, starting with **reading from files**. This is how a program gets its initial intel—from a target list, a config file, or a stolen dossier. This is how you intercept external communications.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Blueprint: Reading a File</h2>
            <p>We use the `open()` function with a `with` statement. This is the safest way, as it automatically closes the file connection when we're done. The `'r'` stands for 'read mode'.</p>
            
            <div class='intel-card'>
                <h3>Code Workbench</h3>
                <p>Imagine we have a text file named `candidates.txt` with the following content:</p>
                <pre><code>Priya Sharma
David Chen
Aisha Khan</code></pre>
                <p>Now, let's write Python code to read that file.</p>
<pre><code>
# The with statement handles opening and closing the file.
# We open 'candidates.txt' in read mode 'r' and give it a temporary name 'f'.
try:
    with open('candidates.txt', 'r') as f:
        # .read() gets the entire content as a single string.
        # all_content = f.read()
        # print(all_content)

        # .readlines() is often more useful. It gets the content
        # as a LIST of strings, with each line as an item.
        candidate_list = f.readlines()

    # Now we can process the list we just read.
    print("--- Intercepted Candidate List ---")
    for candidate in candidate_list:
        # Each line has a hidden newline character at the end.
        # We use .strip() to clean it up.
        print(f"Processing dossier for: {candidate.strip()}")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("ERROR: The file 'candidates.txt' was not found in the directory.")
    print("Mission aborted.")
