                <p>A good plan is useless if the next operative can't understand it. Professionals leave notes. They document their work. In Python, there are two ways to do this: **comments** for brief, informal notes, and **docstrings** for formal, official documentation of a function's purpose.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Blueprint: Comments and Docstrings</h2>
            <div class='intel-card'><h3>Comments (`#`)</h3><p>A comment starts with a hash symbol `#`. The Python interpreter completely ignores anything on the line after the `#`. They are informal messages from the coder to themself or their teammates, explaining *why* a piece of code is written a certain way.</p></div>
            <div class='intel-card'><h3>Docstrings (`"""..."""`)</h3><p>A docstring is a special type of string enclosed in triple-quotes that sits on the very first line after a function definition. It is the function's official documentation. It explains what the function does, what arguments it expects, and what it returns. Professional code is full of docstrings.</p></div>

    This function is a core part of our automated screening process.
