                <h2>Professor's Briefing</h2>
                <p>We have our list of candidates. Now we need to process them, one by one. To perform the same action on every item in a list, we use a **`for` loop**. It is the single most important tool for automation and efficiency. It saves an operative from doing the same boring task over and over. You must understand the loop, Coimbatore.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Blueprint: The `for` Loop</h2>
            <p>A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list) and executes a block of code for each item in that sequence. The syntax is: `for item in list:` followed by an indented block of code.</p>
            
            <div class='intel-card'>
                <h3>Code Workbench</h3>
<pre><code>
candidate_pipeline = ["Priya Sharma", "David Chen", "Aisha Khan", "Maria Garcia"]

print("--- BEGINNING INTERVIEWS ---")

# This loop will take each name from the list, one by one,
# and temporarily store it in the variable 'candidate'.
# Then it will execute the indented code for that candidate.
for candidate in candidate_pipeline:
    # This block of code runs once for each item in the list.
    print(f"Now interviewing: {candidate}")
    print("...interview complete.")

print("--- ALL INTERVIEWS FINISHED ---")


# We can also loop through dictionaries.
employee_dossier = { "name": "Kezia", "role": "Recruiter", "status": "Asset" }

print("\n--- SCANNING DOSSIER ---")
# .items() lets us get both the key and value in each loop.
for key, value in employee_dossier.items():
    print(f"Intel Field: '{key}', Value: '{value}'")

                <h3>Why This Matters To You</h3>
                <p>Loops are the engine of automation. "Send an email to every user in the database." "Calculate the average performance score for every employee." "Generate a report for every open position." All of these are accomplished with loops. When a developer talks about a task taking "milliseconds," it's because a loop is processing thousands of items faster than a human ever could.</p>
