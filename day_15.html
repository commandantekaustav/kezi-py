                <h2>Professor's Briefing</h2>
                <p>No plan is perfect. The phone line might be cut, the getaway driver might be late. The code *will* fail. A professional doesn't hope for the best; they plan for the worst. In Python, this is called **error handling**. We use a `try...except` block to create a contingency plan for when things go wrong.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Blueprint: The `try...except` Block</h2>
            <p>You put the risky code in the `try` block. If an error occurs, the code in the `except` block is executed, and the program doesn't crash. It allows the operation to continue even if one part fails.</p>
            
            <div class='intel-card'>
                <h3>Code Workbench</h3>
<pre><code>
candidate_score_str = input("Enter candidate's test score (as a number): ")

# What if the user types 'eighty' instead of '80'? 
# The int() conversion will fail and crash the program.
# We need a contingency plan.

try:
    # We attempt the risky operation.
    score = int(candidate_score_str)
    print(f"Score successfully recorded as: {score}")
    # ... more code here to process the score ...

except ValueError:
    # This block only runs if a ValueError occurs in the try block.
    # (e.g., trying to convert text to a number).
    print("Error: Invalid input. Score must be a number.")
    print("Assigning default score of 0.")
    score = 0

print(f"\nFinal score being used for evaluation: {score}")

                <h3>Why This Matters To You</h3>
                <p>Robust, professional software is filled with `try...except` blocks. It anticipates user mistakes, network failures, and bad data. When you see a developer writing this, you are watching them build a resilient, failure-proof system. It is a hallmark of a senior, experienced mind—someone who has seen plans fail before and learned from it.</p>

            <p class='note'>Professor's Note: Your 'Conflict Resolution' skill applies here. `try` is your plan. `except` is your graceful, pre-planned response to conflict. You're a natural at this, Kezia.</p>
