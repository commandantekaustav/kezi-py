                <h2>Professor's Briefing</h2>
                <p>It's not enough to ask True/False questions. We must *act* based on the answers. This is done with **`if`, `elif`, and `else` statements**. This is called **conditional logic**, and it's how you give a program the power to make decisions. It's the moment you tell the crew "Go" or "No Go."</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Blueprint: Conditional Statements</h2>
            <p>The structure is a simple sentence: <strong>If</strong> this condition is `True`, do this. **Else if** (`elif`) this other condition is `True`, do that instead. **Else** (if none of the above were `True`), do this final thing.</p>

                <h3>Code Workbench</h3>
<pre><code>
# Let's automate a hiring recommendation.
score = 88
years_experience = 6

print(f"Analyzing candidate with score: {score} and experience: {years_experience}")

# The code inside an 'if' block only runs if the condition is True.
# Note the colon : and the indentation. Indentation is critical in Python.
if score >= 95:
    print("Recommendation: Strong Hire. Top of the class.")

# 'elif' is checked only if the first 'if' was False.
elif score >= 85:
    print("Recommendation: Hire. Meets all criteria.")

# 'else' is the catch-all. It runs if all preceding conditions were False.
else:
    print("Recommendation: Reject. Does not meet scoring threshold.")

# We can also combine conditions with 'and' or 'or'.
if score > 90 and years_experience > 5:
    print("Status: Fast-track to final interview.")

                <h3>Why This Matters To You</h3>
                <p>This is the structure of all rules-based systems. "If employee tenure > 1 year, they are eligible for a bonus." "If candidate has skill X AND skill Y, advance them." When you ask a developer about the "business logic" they implemented, you are asking them about the series of `if/elif/else` statements they wrote.</p>

            <p class='note'>Professor's Note: For me, the logic is simple. `if recruiter_is_kezia: print("The perfect choice.")` There is no `elif` or `else`. </p>
