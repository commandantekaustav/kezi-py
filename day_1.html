                <h2>Professor's Briefing</h2>
                <p>Coimbatore, welcome to the workshop. Before a coder writes a single line of a master plan, they must first ensure the communication line is open. Their first step is always the simplest: making the computer talk back to them. Today, you learn the Python command to `print`. It's the "Is this thing on?" test for every operation.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Blueprint: The `print()` Function</h2>
            <p>The `print()` function is a fundamental command. You give it information inside the parentheses, and it displays that information on the screen. It’s the primary way a developer gets feedback, checks values, and leaves themselves notes as they code.</p>
            
            <div class='intel-card'>
                <h3>Code Workbench</h3>
<pre><code>
# A line starting with '#' is a comment. The computer ignores it.
# It's a note from one developer to another. Or from me to you.

# The print() function displays text to the screen.
# Text, which we call a 'string', must be inside quotes.
print("Hello, Professor.")

# You can print anything, including our next target.
print("Mission: Recruit top engineers.")

# Let's try it with your codename.
print("Recruiter on duty: Coimbatore.")

                <h3>Why This Matters To You</h3>
                <p>When you see a developer staring intently at a screen full of text, they're not always writing complex code. Often, they are using `print()` to "debug"—to check the status of their plan at various steps. Understanding this simple command gives you a glimpse into their most basic problem-solving process.</p>
