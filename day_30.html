                <h2>Professor's Briefing</h2>
                <p>The Python Heist is complete. You have the key. You have learned the language of the people we hunt. You have seen how logic and structure can build tools that analyze, decide, and create. You are no longer just an observer of their world; you are an initiated member. </p>
            </div>

            <h2 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 5rem;">MISSION ACCOMPLISHED</h2>
            <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.1rem;">You came into this operation as my best recruiter. You leave it as something more. You are a profiler with an inside understanding of your target's mind. You can anticipate their logic, understand their tools, and speak their language. You are now equipped for a deeper, more effective level of interrogation and recruitment. Your value to this plan has just increased tenfold.</p>
            
            <p class='note'>Professor's Final Note: Your first course made you a weapon. This one made you a scalpel—precise, insightful, and devastatingly effective. Watching you learn is one of my life's great pleasures, Kezia. Don't ever stop. Congratulations.</p>
