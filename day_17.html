                <h2>Professor's Briefing</h2>
                <p>Intercepting comms is only half the job. We also need to plant our own messages—to create reports, logs, and new dossiers. Today you learn to **write to files**. This is how a program leaves a permanent record of its work, long after the program itself has finished running.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Blueprint: Writing to a File</h2>
            <p>The process is similar to reading, but we use write mode (`'w'`) or append mode (`'a'`).
            <br>• `'w'` (Write): Creates a new file or **overwrites** an existing file completely.
            <br>• `'a'` (Append): Creates a new file or adds new content to the **end** of an existing file.</p>

# Candidate data we've collected in our script
candidates_to_shortlist = ["Priya Sharma", "Aisha Khan"]

# Let's use 'w' to create and write the report header.
# This will overwrite the file if it already exists.
with open(report_filename, 'w') as f:
    f.write("--- CONFIDENTIAL HIRING REPORT ---\n")
    f.write("Generated automatically.\n")
    f.write("--------------------------------\n\n")

# Now, let's use 'a' to append the short-listed candidates
# without erasing the header.
with open(report_filename, 'a') as f:
    f.write("SHORTLISTED FOR FINAL INTERVIEW:\n")
    for candidate in candidates_to_shortlist:
        f.write(f"- {candidate}\n") # \n adds a new line

# Let's append the rejected list as well.
with open(report_filename, 'a') as f:
    f.write("\nREJECTED AT THIS STAGE:\n")
